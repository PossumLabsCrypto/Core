/// @notice This governance contract allows PSM stakers to collectively control incentive distributions and be rewarded
/* Users make a committment to stake PSM at least for a chosen duration upon staking
/* The longer the commitment period, the higher the Core Fragments (CF) accrual APR
/* CF can be spent to distribute PSM incentives to allowed addresses that are listed by the Guardian
/* The Guardian can list and delist addresses. There will be at least 1 permanent address that cannot be delisted.
/* Every 1 CF spent provides 1 PSM in rewards to the staker.(if there are enough rewards)
/* The CF accrual APR is applied to the combined balance of staked PSM and earned rewards which enables compounding
/* Staked PSM can be unstaked anytime irrespective of the chosen stake duration
/* If a stake is withdrawn before the stake duration passed, accumulated rewards are forfeited proportionally
/* If users unstake after the stake expired, they receive their original stake and all accrued rewards
/* Users can add more PSM to their existing stake but must stake at least as long as the remaining commitment period
/* Users can remain staked to accrue CF and compound rewards after their commitment period has passed
